#### Scrolling
Ledger screen can only fit around 20 characters and therefore we need a way for displaying the key and the value strings that are longer. Here we assume that the page info will always fit the screen line.

Ledger supports the smooth pixel scrolling which is enabled by default for the line #3 (i.e. the line that holds the json value). If a text is longer than (around) 20 characters, then Ledger will automatically start scrolling the line.

We are currently using 256 bytes long buffer to keep the value string. If the value read from the json transaction is longer than that, then we split it into 256 chunks and display and scroll each chunk individually. 

Here's an example:

Screen 3. 
```
LINE1: [left icon]       PREVIEW - 03/08         [right icon]
LINE2:                    fee - 01/02
LINE3:            {"amount":[{"denom":"photon", "a [first 256 bytes of the value]
```

Screen 3a. 
```
LINE1: [left icon]       PREVIEW - 03/08         [right icon]
LINE2:                    fee - 02/02
LINE3:               mount":5}], "gas":10000}     [the next 256 bytes of the value]
```

We'll use term: 'Value Chunk Preview' to describe this mode.

#### Interface:
##### Left click
Moves to the previous screen, unless the current screen is #1, in which case it switches back to the 'Received Transaction' page.
##### Right click
Moves to the next screen, unless the current screen is the last one, in which case it switches back to the 'Received Transaction' page.
##### Double click
Switches back to the 'View Transaction' page
##### Left hold
Same as Left click, unless we are in the 'Value Chunk Preview', in which case we step out from the 'Value Chunk Preview' and skip to the previous screen.
##### Right hold
Same as Right click, unless we are in the 'Value Chunk Preview', in which case we step out from the 'Value Chunk Preview' and skip to the next screen.
